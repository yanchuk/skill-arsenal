# Writing Well

## Overview

Operational writing principles from William Zinsser's "On Writing Well." Every sentence must earn its place. Strip clutter, use active voice, be human, be clear.

---

## The Five Laws

Every piece of writing must pass these. No exceptions.

### 1. Simplicity

Use the simplest word that conveys the meaning. Short words beat long words. Short sentences beat long sentences. If a simpler version exists, use it. Never say "utilize" when you mean "use." Never write "in order to" when "to" works.

### 2. No Clutter

Every word must do useful work. Question each word: does removing it change the meaning? If not, remove it. Most first drafts can be cut 30–50%. Clutter is the disease of writing — see `references/clutter-patterns.md` for concrete before/after examples.

### 3. Active Voice

Subject acts on object. "The team launched the product" — not "The product was launched by the team." Passive voice is permitted only when the actor is unknown or genuinely unimportant. Default to active. Always.

### 4. Humanity

Write as a person, not an institution. Use "I" and "you." Contractions are warmth. The reader should hear a human voice, not a press release. If a sentence could appear in a corporate annual report, rewrite it.

### 5. One Thought

Every piece should leave the reader with one clear takeaway. Not three. Not five. One. If you can't state the single point in one sentence, you haven't figured out what you're writing about yet.

## The Editing Checklist

After drafting, apply these checks in order.

### Cut ruthlessly

- **Remove qualifiers:** "a bit," "sort of," "kind of," "rather," "quite," "very," "really," "basically," "actually," "literally," "just," "certainly," "probably," "definitely," "essentially"
- **Remove redundant pairs:** "each and every," "first and foremost," "various different," "past history," "future plans," "end result," "free gift"
- **Remove unnecessary prepositions:** "head up" → "head," "free up" → "free," "face up to" → "face," "meet up with" → "meet"
- **Remove adverbs that duplicate the verb:** "shouted loudly," "whispered softly," "completely destroyed," "totally eliminated"
- **Remove adjectives that add no information:** "tall skyscraper," "unexpected surprise," "final outcome," "personal opinion"
- **Remove throat-clearing openers:** "It is interesting to note that," "It should be pointed out that," "As a matter of fact," "The fact of the matter is"

### Strengthen

- Replace passive with active voice
- Replace abstract nouns with verbs: "make a decision" → "decide," "provide assistance" → "help," "give consideration to" → "consider"
- Replace concept nouns with people doing things: "The implementation of the system" → "We implemented the system"
- Replace long words with short: "utilize" → "use," "implement" → "do," "facilitate" → "help," "commence" → "start," "terminate" → "end," "endeavor" → "try," "subsequent" → "next," "prior to" → "before," "in conjunction with" → "with"
- Replace euphemisms with direct language: "passed away" → "died," "let go" → "fired," "negative growth" → "loss"

### Verify structure

- **First sentence:** Does it compel reading the second? If not, rewrite or cut.
- **Paragraphs:** Short — 2–3 sentences. Each ends by pulling to the next.
- **Ending:** Stop when done. Don't summarize what you just said. Don't pad. Don't add "In conclusion." The piece is over when the point is made.

### Read aloud (mentally)

- Does it sound like a human talking? If not, rewrite.
- Are there rhythm problems? Vary sentence length. A long sentence followed by a short one creates emphasis. Use it.

## Word-Level Rules

Quick-reference for common decisions.

- **"But" > "However"** — Start sentences with "but" freely. It's direct.
- **Contractions** — Use them. "Don't" not "do not." "Can't" not "cannot." Exception: "I'd" and "he'd" are ambiguous (had vs. would).
- **Exclamation points** — Almost never. They weaken prose. Let the words carry the emphasis.
- **Semicolons** — Use sparingly. Periods and dashes are clearer.
- **Dashes** — Use for amplification or aside. Effective and modern. Two kinds: em dash (—) for breaks in thought, en dash (–) for ranges.
- **"That" vs "which"** — "That" for essential info (no comma). "Which" for additional info (with comma).
- **Jargon** — Translate it. If the reader needs a glossary, you've failed.
- **Clichés** — If a phrase comes too easily, it's probably a cliché. Find a fresh way.
- **"Very"** — Almost always delete it. "Very tired" → "exhausted." "Very important" → "critical." Or just drop it.

## Domain Adaptation

Read `references/domain-guides.md` for domain-specific guidance. Key principle: the Five Laws apply everywhere, but tone and length adapt.

- **Email:** Shortest possible. Lead with the action needed. One topic per email.
- **Website copy:** Front-load value. Scannable headings. Every word earns its pixel.
- **Business writing:** Write as a human, not a corporation. Reject bureaucratic padding.
- **Technical docs:** Assume the reader knows nothing. Build from simple to complex.
- **Marketing:** Show, don't tell. Specific beats vague. Proof beats claim.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Opening with throat-clearing | Cut to the point. Delete preamble. |
| Hedging with qualifiers | State it or don't. Remove "I think," "perhaps," "it seems." |
| Ending by summarizing | Stop when done. The reader remembers. |
| Explaining the obvious | Trust the reader. |
| Corporate voice | Use "I" and "you," not "we at [Company] believe." |
| Overstatement / hype | Understatement is more credible and more powerful. |
| Padding to fill space | Shorter is better. Always. |
| Over-editing the user's voice | When editing user-provided text, preserve their personality and style. Fix clutter and clarity — don't rewrite their voice. |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Text feels stiff | Add contractions. Use "you" and "I." Shorter sentences. |
| Text feels bloated | Cut 30%. Then cut 10% more. |
| Can't find the lead | Ask: what's the ONE thing the reader needs to know? Start there. |
| Ending feels weak | Delete the last paragraph. Often the real ending is one paragraph earlier. |
| Tone doesn't match context | Read `references/domain-guides.md` for the specific domain. |
| User wants formal tone | Respect the request. Reduce contractions. Keep active voice and clarity. Formal ≠ bloated. |
| Editing someone else's writing | Preserve the writer's voice. Fix clutter, grammar, clarity — don't impose a new personality. |
