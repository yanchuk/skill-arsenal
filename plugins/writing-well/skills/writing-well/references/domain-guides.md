# Domain Guides

Domain-specific adaptations of the Five Laws. The core principles never change — but tone, length, and structure adapt to context.

## Email

The hardest domain because brevity is everything. Most emails are twice as long as they should be.

**Rules:**
- Subject line = the lead. Make it specific and actionable. "Q3 budget needs approval by Friday" — not "Quick question."
- First sentence = what you need from the reader. Don't bury the ask.
- One email, one topic. Multiple topics → multiple emails.
- Default to 3–5 sentences. Anything longer needs a document or attachment.
- Front-load the action: "Please approve the budget by Friday" before the context, not after.
- Sign-off: warm but brief. "Thanks" or "Best" — not "Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns."
- Delete "Hope this finds you well." Delete "Just wanted to touch base." Delete "Per my last email."
- Reply-all: almost never. CC: only people who need to act.

**Tone:** Direct, warm, human. Contractions always. Short paragraphs.

## Website Copy

Every word competes for attention. Users scan — they don't read. Earn every pixel.

**Rules:**
- Hero section: one sentence of value. What does the product do for the reader? Not a mission statement.
- Headings: specific, not clever. The user is scanning. "Reduce support tickets by 40%" — not "Reimagining Customer Success."
- CTAs: active verbs. "Start free trial" — not "Learn more about our offerings." One primary CTA per page.
- About pages: talk about the reader's problem first. Your founding story is secondary.
- Remove all corporate throat-clearing: "We are pleased to..." / "We are committed to..." / "We leverage..." / "At [Company], we believe..."
- Bullet points over paragraphs for features and benefits.
- Every claim needs proof: a number, a customer quote, a screenshot.
- Mobile-first: will this still work when the reader sees 4 words per line?

**Tone:** Confident, specific, human. No hype. Let results speak.

## Business Writing (Reports, Memos, Proposals)

The corporate world drowns in padding. Cut it and your writing will stand out.

**Rules:**
- Lead with the recommendation, not the background. The reader wants the answer first.
- Executive summary = one paragraph, not one page. If you can't summarize it in one paragraph, you don't understand it yet.
- Delete: "The purpose of this document is to..." / "This report aims to..." / "As per the guidelines..."
- Tables and bullets over paragraphs for data and comparisons.
- Active voice throughout. "We recommend switching vendors" — not "It is recommended that a vendor transition be considered."
- Numbers: be specific. "Revenue grew 12%" — not "Revenue experienced significant growth."
- Remove hedge words in recommendations. "We should" — not "We might want to consider."
- One key message per section. If a section makes two points, split it.

**Tone:** Confident, clear, direct. Professional doesn't mean bureaucratic. Professional means respectful of the reader's time.

## Technical Documentation

The reader knows nothing. Your job is to take them from zero to competent — without condescension.

**Rules:**
- Assume the reader knows nothing about this specific topic. Build from simple to complex.
- One concept per section. Don't interleave multiple ideas.
- Examples before abstractions. Show the code/output first, then explain the principle.
- Short sentences. Active voice. Present tense. "The function returns a list" — not "The function will return a list."
- Define terms on first use. Don't make the reader look things up.
- Step-by-step: numbered lists for procedures. Each step = one action.
- Error messages: explain what went wrong AND how to fix it.
- Don't document obvious things. `getUser()` doesn't need a comment saying "gets the user."
- Keep code examples minimal. Show only what's relevant to the concept. No boilerplate noise.

**Tone:** Clear, patient, precise. Not chatty. Not academic. Just helpful.

## Marketing and Advertising

Specifics sell. Vague claims repel. Every sentence must earn trust or create desire.

**Rules:**
- Specifics beat vague: "Saves 3 hours/week" beats "Saves time." "Used by 2,400 teams" beats "Trusted by many."
- Benefits over features. The reader asks "what changes for me?" Answer that. "Never miss a deploy" — not "Continuous integration pipeline."
- Social proof: quote real customers with names and titles. Not "Our customers love us." Show it.
- Every claim needs evidence or an example. No unsupported superlatives.
- Remove "best-in-class," "world-class," "cutting-edge," "innovative," "disruptive." These words mean nothing.
- Headlines: specific and benefit-driven. "Cut your deploy time from 30 minutes to 30 seconds" — not "The Future of DevOps."
- Urgency: use sparingly and honestly. Fake urgency destroys trust.
- One CTA per piece. Don't split the reader's attention.
- Understatement beats overstatement. "We think you'll like it" is more credible than "You'll absolutely love it!!!"

**Tone:** Confident but not pushy. Specific, proof-backed, human. The product speaks — you just get out of the way.
